# CemeterySurveyor
A flexible cemetery research surveying tool.

Cemetery Surveyor is designed to be part of a survey workflow consisting of:
* the creation of an ontology,
* the designing of a survey consisting of categories and attributes defined in a JSON template,
* the designating of cemetery, cemetery sections and graves in a GIS with unique identifiers,
* the actual surveying of the cemetery using the application,
* the exporting of gathered data back into a GIS or statistical analysis program.

    The application is useless without the appropriate [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serialc/CemeterySurveyor/master/Documentation/documentation.pdf). The documentation is currently located on GitHub with the source code: https://github.com/serialc/CemeterySurveyor

    This application was funded by the University of Luxembourg (http://wwwen.uni.lu/).
